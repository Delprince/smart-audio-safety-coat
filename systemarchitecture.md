## Overview
The Smart Audio Safety Coat is a wearable hardware system designed to provide open-ear audio, hands-free calls, and safe communication for construction workers.This document describes the technical blueprint, including the hardware components, system workflow, communication flow, and feasibility of the architecture.
## Frontend (User Interaction Layer)
No software frontend required. 
# User interaction happens through:
Play/Pause
Answer/End call
Volume up/Down
# Bluetooth pairing interface on the worker's mobile device
# LED indicator light showing charging or pairing status (this can be optional)
## Backend (Core Processing Layer)
# Bluetooth Audio Module
Receives wireless signals from mobile phone for music or call.
# Microcontroller/logic 
Manage incoming signals to speakers and button actions
# Power Management Circuit
Control battery usage, charging and power distribution
# Audio output  driver
ensure safe sound levels for open-ear listening
## Database Layer
This device does not require database because; It does not log activity, save audio or call history and does not store user profile.
## Component Communication flow
# how it works
The workers pairs their phone with the coat via bluetooth
The bluetooth module receieves audio signals

## Technical Feasibility
Bluetooth modles are not expensive, easily integrated in wearables and small
Mini open-ear speakers are lightweight and safe for construction environment
Rechargeable Li-ion or Li-poly batteries fits easily inside the shoulder padding (Li is simply lithium)
Internal wiring is standard in smart clothing and does not affect comfort
The system uses low power, enabling multiple times of playback in hours
Lastly, system component are readily avaliable and support rapid prototying should in case there is need.
## Future Enhancements
Improve battery life
Emergency alert system
IoT connectivity for worksite managemant
Integrate npoice suppression microphone
Waterproofing of electronic component
Dedicate mobile app for button customization.
